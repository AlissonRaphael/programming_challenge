/**
 * Growing Sequences
 * Your program must read an integer X indefinited times (the program must stop when X is equal to zero). For each X print the sequence from 1 to X, with one space between each one of these numbers.
 * 
 * PS: Be carefull. Don't leave any space after the last number of each line, otherwise you'll get Presentation Error.
 * 
 * Input
 * The input file contains many integer numbers. The last one is zero.
 * 
 * Output
 * For each number N of the input file, one output line must be printed, from 1 to N like the following example. Be careful with blank spaces after the last line number.
