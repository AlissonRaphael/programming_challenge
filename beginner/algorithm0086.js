/**
 * Sum of Consecutive Even Numbers
 * The program must read an integer X indefinite times (stop when X=0). For each X, print the sum of five consecutive even numbers from X, including it if X is even. If the input number is 4, for example, the output must be 40, that is the result of the operation: 4+6+8+10+12. If the input number is 11, for example, the output must be 80, that is the result of 12+14+16+18+20.
 * 
 * Input
 * The input file contains many integer numbers. The last one is zero.
 * 
 * Output
 * Print the output according to the example below.
