 * 
 * In one hour (60 minutes) the car Y can get a distance of 30 kilometers from the X car, in other words, it can get away one kilometer for each 2 minutes.
 * 
 * Read the distance (in km) and calculate how long it takes (in minutes) for the car Y to take this distance in relation to the other car.
 *
